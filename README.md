# Focus Timer

The Focus Timer app is a simple productivity application that helps users manage their time and increase productivity by breaking down their work into focused intervals, known as "pomodoros". The app is built using SwiftUI and is designed to run as a macOS menu bar app.

The app is built using MVVM architecture, which separates the application logic and data from the UI. This makes it easier to test and maintain the code. The Menu Bar Extra API is used to create a custom menu bar item that allows users to access the app's features quickly and easily.

The user interface of the app includes a timer that counts down the pomodoro intervals and displays notifications when each interval is complete. Users can adjust the length of each pomodoro interval and take breaks between intervals.

Overall, the Focus Timer app is a useful tool for anyone looking to improve their time management and productivity. Its simple, intuitive interface and customizable features make it easy to use and adaptable to a variety of work styles.
